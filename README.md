# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, client-side Single-Page Twitter clone app.

The client-side app communicates with a server via AJAX. The tweets are persisted to MongoDB and survive server restart. 

This project was built with HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX on the client-side and with Node, Express and MongoDB back-end.
